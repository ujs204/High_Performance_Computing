Our plan for the final project is to solve the Multigrid Method using MPI and OMP. 
Specifically, we are going to use restriction matrices and prolongation as our techniques in solving the Multigrid Method. 
Then, after we call the Jacobi method for some number of iterations, we achieve our result. 
As of now, we have already parallelized the portions that include the Jacobi and residual method.
